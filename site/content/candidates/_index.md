       Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate.

      * If you're updating state whenever props change, refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps. Learn more at: https://fb.me/react-derived-state

      * Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE*componentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE* name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.
